# WowheadPlusPlus
World of Warcraft is an immensely vast fantasy game. It has been on the market for over a decade, with continuous updates and expansions. The content in that game is over 50 gigabytes worth. Hence, capturing all data and analyzing the gameâ€™s content, which is an accumulation of more than a decade of data, is definitely no easy task. Our project would act as a service to the player-base: it would allow them to search through the gigabytes of data the game offers to further improve their gameplay and immersion: **ALLOWING THEM TO PLAY MORE AND RESEARCH LESS**. This project is for CS 317 Spring 2018 instructed by Dr. Stansbury.
