# WowheadPlusPlus
World of Warcraft is an immensely vast fantasy game. It has been on the market for over a decade, with continuous updates and expansions. The content in that game is over 50 gigabytes worth. Hence, capturing all data and analyzing the game’s content, which is an accumulation of more than a decade of data, is definitely no easy task. Our project would act as a service to the player-base: it would allow them to search through the gigabytes of data the game offers to further improve their gameplay and immersion: **ALLOWING THEM TO PLAY MORE AND RESEARCH LESS**. This project is for CS 317 Spring 2018 instructed by Dr. Stansbury.
